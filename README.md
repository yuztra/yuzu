# yuzu archive by yuztra
An archive of yuzu source code and binaries as of 29 February 2024.

Around March 2024, Nintendo decided to abuse their legal powers and take down yuzu for good. It's really sad to see this big project get taken down, and I think it should be preserved.

## Note for Nintendo
I live in Indonesia, which is well outside your legal territory. So, if you are seeing this Nintendo, you can't do anything.
